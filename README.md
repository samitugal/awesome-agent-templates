## About

**Awesome Agent Templates** is a community project that aims to make **AI agent development simple, reusable, and open**.

Think of it as *“the GitHub of AI agents.”*  
We collect, standardize, and share high-quality **agent templates** so anyone can build and run powerful AI systems — without starting from scratch.

Whether you’re using **LangChain**, **Semantic Kernel**, **CrewAI**, **Agno**, or any MCP-compatible platform, you’ll find reusable agent blueprints here.

> One language for all agents.  
> One format, infinite possibilities.

## Why It Exists

The AI world moves fast — but agent development is still fragmented.  
Every framework reinvents the wheel. Every developer writes the same boilerplate.

We believe:
- **Standards accelerate progress**
- **Knowledge grows when shared**
- **Good ideas should be reusable**

Our goal is to build the **open standard for agent definitions** — a foundation every framework can build on.

## What You’ll Find Here

### Agent Templates
Reusable YAML definitions for different agent types:
- WebSearchAgent — find and summarize information  
- PlannerAgent — break goals into tasks  
- CodeExecutorAgent — run & test code  
- SummarizerAgent — condense long content  
- PersonaAgent — act with a specific role or tone  

Each template follows a simple schema — name, tools, reasoning level, memory settings, metadata — everything an agent needs to come alive.

### Framework Agnostic
Write once, deploy anywhere.  
Each agent can run across multiple ecosystems: LangChain, Semantic Kernel, CrewAI, Agno, AutoGen, or even custom MCP setups.

### Beautiful Interface
Browse templates visually, just like [prompts.chat](https://prompts.chat) —  
but with more power: reasoning filters, framework compatibility, YAML previews, and clickable provider icons (Agno, SK, etc.).

### Evolving Into Code
The next evolution?  
Agent generation.  
You’ll soon be able to choose a framework and language (Python, C#, JS) — and automatically generate runnable code from our templates.

## How to Contribute

**We’re a community project, your ideas shape this ecosystem.**

### Add a New Agent
1. Fork the repo  
2. Copy `templates/example-agent.yaml`  
3. Fill in your agent’s details  
4. Submit a PR with a clear description  

We’ll validate it, review it, and feature it on the site!

### Improve the Docs
- Add new built-in tools
- Add new MCP servers
- Simplify explanations  
- Add usage examples  
- Translate to other languages  
- Fix typos or add links  

### Suggest Features
Open a discussion for:
- New schema fields  
- Framework adapters  
- Language generators  
- MCP registry integrations

## Community

We’re building a place where AI engineers, researchers, and creators share what they learn — not just code, but ideas.

Join us if you believe in:
- Collaboration over competition  
- Open knowledge for everyone  
- Building things that last

## 🔮 Future Works

The *Awesome Agent Templates* project is designed to evolve with the community and we’re already trying to explore ambitious next steps.

### 1. Framework-Aware Code Generation
Imagine this:  
You pick a template like `WebSearchAgent`, choose your target framework (`LangChain`, `Semantic Kernel`, `Agno`, `CrewAI`, etc.), and select a language (`Python`, `C#`, `TypeScript`).

Then — **boom** — the system generates a **ready-to-run agent code** using the metadata in the YAML file.

The generator will:
- Parse the agent’s reasoning level, tools, and connectivity  
- Match each tool with known framework adapters  
- Inject the correct imports, classes, and initialization patterns  
- Output clean, runnable code for your chosen stack  

Example:
```bash
aat generate WebSearchAgent --framework semantic-kernel --lang python
```
